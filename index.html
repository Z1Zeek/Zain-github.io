        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Zain Ali! I am a passionate individual with a love for basketball, technology, and video games.</p>
        <p>I'm deeply interested in the intersection of technology and society, particularly how advancements in information technology can be leveraged to create positive change in communities around the world.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technologies at Oakland Community College. I am also a student at Clarenceville High School, located on Middlebelt Road and 8 Mile Road. 
		I've been participating in the Accelerated College Experience program for almost two years, which has allowed me to simultaneously earn high school and college credits.
		I have one more year remaining at Oakland Community College before completing my degree.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me on the basketball court, exploring the latest in technology, or even playing video games.</p>
        <p>I'm also trying to learn about and start doing community service and volunteer work (as I need it for my ACE program with around 40 - 100 hours). 
		I believe in giving back to society, mainly by passing it forward. It can range from helping someone in general or even with money or food.</p>
